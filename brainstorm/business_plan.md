## Business Structure

Partnership. All good businesses have one point of contact with complete control and authority. That is the person who sets the vision and culture of the company. Starting a company is hard. I need a quick thinking, strong, excited, engergized, and complete grinder of a co-founder.

## Business Concept

Our product allows users to have a personalized AI assistant/guardian angel/buddy that can do remove unecessary and redundant tasks. First, we want to start out with a text interface using Toolsformer, kind of like chatGPT. Then we can create a website/app that can use the devices microphone to interact with. This will be a subscription based model, with upgradable models. From there, we can start collecting data from the users and start specializing our models. With a growing user base, we can get initial VC money to starting building data centers and compute clusters. All profits are put directly back into research and development. We can then start finetuning and perfecting our models and datasets for our purposes. Then, we can create a physical device for you to carry around with, or place in your home. From there, we can create an assortment of insanely great products that aid in creating more time for individuals.
