Alexa skills are developed by third-party developers using the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), a collection of APIs, tools, and documentation that enables developers to create voice-driven experiences for Alexa. These skills can be designed for a variety of purposes, such as playing games, checking the weather, ordering food, controlling smart home devices, and much more.

To use an Alexa skill, a user must first enable the skill in the Alexa app, either by searching for it or by saying a specific voice command. Once enabled, the user can interact with the skill by speaking to Alexa and issuing specific voice commands that are specific to that skill.

It starts with signal processing, which gives Alexa as many chances as possible to make sense of the audio by cleaning the signal. Signal processing is one of the most important challenges in far-field audio.

To resolve these issues, seven microphones are used to identify roughly where the signal is coming from so the device can focus on it.

If the wake word is detected, the signal is then sent to the speech recognition software in the cloud, which takes the audio and converts it to text format.

After, Alexa enabled devices sends the user’s instruction to a cloud-based service called Alexa Voice Service (AVS)

Amazon allows and encourages approved developers free access to Alexa Voice Services so they can create new Alexa skills to augment the system’s skill-set just as Apple did with the app store

For Echos to become as pervasive as smartphones, they will need to do many more things. To that end, Amazon is encouraging independent developers to build new services on the platform, just as Apple has long done with app developers.

“They have to fight traffic to get home, and then they have to feed the kids, diaper the baby, and who knows what else. We give them a hands-free way of getting something done while they’re in the midst of other tasks.”

The ultimate triumph for voice-based AI would be to carry on a realistic, multi-minute conversation with users.

The reason Alexa has been utterly dependent on the cloud until recently is the demands of natural language processing
