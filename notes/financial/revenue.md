This will have to be a subscription based model. 

If chatGPT is ~$20, then ours will have to be more expensive at the start. However, we can start at a higher price and as we develop more we can drive down the price for it to be affordable for everyone.

I'm thinking about $100/month is reasonable for something like this. We can start off with a little subsection of out market (which is really anyone who has things to do...professionals...managers...studetns...coaches...etc).

I believe that this is something that is also incredibly useful for anyone...with all of the time saved $100/month might be a bargain. 

Very reasonable first year revenue:
$100/month * 10,000 people = $1,000,000/month
This would put us at ~$20 million dollar valuation.

We popping off revenue:
$20/month * 100,000,000 people = $2B/month 
This would put us at a ~$20 billion dollar valuation.

World changing revenue:
$10/month * 2,000,000,000 = $20B/month
This would put us at a ~$2.4 Trillion dollar valuation
