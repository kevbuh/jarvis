It seems like we are gonna need some a100 gpus. They cost about $10k each.

Most GPT's are trained using 8 a100's. That's about $80k. 

Lets say that it is more like $100k for installation and taxes.

So, we have an up front cost of $100k. 

In order to pay that off, we would need to have:

$50/month * 12 months in year = $600 per month per user

$100,000 / $600 == 166 users

I feel like that is pretty reasonable, if we actually have a good product. Goal is to make this thing $10/month. Like a Spotify or Netflix subscription, but much more useful.
