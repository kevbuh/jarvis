# On-Device End-to-End LLM Google Extension and Mobile App

This project consists of three different but similar mini-projects, where I looked into what it would take to start making machine-learning powered tools.

1. Inference Pipeline
* [Link](https://github.com/kevbuh/jarvis/blob/main/jarvis/gpt2.py)
* Engineered an inference and training process for real-time results, resulting in an 86.35% decrease in inference time

Google Extension:

* Made a google extension that explains highlighted text

React Native & Flask App

* The entire app was developed in one weekend! Its pretty much a reverse engineering of the Siri interface, but using the GPT-4 API.
