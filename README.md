# Four Mini Projects In One!

This project consists of four different but similar mini-projects, where I looked into what it would take to start making machine-learning powered tools.
<br/>

## 1. [BabbleGPT: A Small Generative Pretrained Transformer](https://github.com/kevbuh/babbleGPT)
* Engineered a training and inference process for real-time results, resulting in an ~86.35% decrease in inference time
* Allowed for finetuning of your data, by being able to learn on any .txt file

## 2. [Lookup: Google Extension that Explains Highlighted Text](https://github.com/kevbuh/lookup)
* I created a Google extension that explains highlighted text on your browser

## 3. [GPT-2 Performance Tracker](https://github.com/kevbuh/jarvis/blob/main/jarvis/gpt2.py)

## 4. [Savvy+Audio+GPT: Siri Remake in React Native & Flask App](https://github.com/kevbuh/audiogpt)
* I made this app in one weekend! It's pretty much a reverse engineering of Siri, but updated using the GPT-3.5 API
