# On-Device End-to-End LLM Google Extension and Mobile App

This project consists of four different but similar mini-projects, where I looked into what it would take to start making machine-learning powered tools.

## 1. [Small Language Model](https://github.com/kevbuh/babbleGPT)
* Engineered a training and inference process for real-time results, resulting in an 86.35% decrease in inference time
* Allowed for finetuning of your data, by being able to learn on any .txt file

## 2. [Google Extension](https://github.com/kevbuh/lookup)
* Made a Google extension that explains highlighted text

## 3. [GPT-2 Performance Tracker](https://github.com/kevbuh/jarvis/blob/main/jarvis/gpt2.py)

## 4. [Siri Remake in React Native & Flask App](https://github.com/kevbuh/audiogpt)
* I made this app in one weekend! It's pretty much a reverse engineering of the Siri interface, but using the GPT-4 API
